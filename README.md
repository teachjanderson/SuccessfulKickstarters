# Analysis of Successful Kickstarter Campaigns
Description: This analysis suggests criteria for a successful Kickstarter campaign based on launch date and goal amount in the area of performing arts.

# Overview of the Project
**Background**

Louise wanted an analysis to show how campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using a Kickstarter dataset, we were able to organize and analyze the data for these key trends and recommend several goals to help her reach her fundraising goal. The following analysis includes explanations and visuals to better illustrate these recommendations. 

**Goal**

The goal of this project was providing my client, Louise, with two criteria in ensuring a successful Kickstarter campaign in the area of performing arts. These are a preferred launch date and a suggested goal amount. Through analzying over 1000 successful and failed campaigns, ranging back nearly ten years and from less than $1000 to more than $50,000, it is possible to provide suggestions on these two key metrics. 

# Outcomes

**Categorical Outcomes**

Louise was interested in performances of theatrical natures such as theater and plays. Fortunately, an initial analysis determined these as some of the most successful campaigns compared to other performance types. The data demonstrated a success rate for theater of nearly 60%. This support Louise in her desire to launch a theatrical campaign.

**Outcomes by Date**

Louise was also interested in the best time of year to launch her campaign. After careful review of the data, May, June, or July had the best success rates throughout the year, with May providing the most successful outcomes with over 100 successful campaigns compared the fall or winter which averaged 60 or fewer successful campaigns.
