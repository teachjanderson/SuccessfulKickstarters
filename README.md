# Analysis of Successful Kickstarter Campaigns
Description: This analysis suggests criteria for a successful Kickstarter campaign based on launch date and goal amount in the area of performing arts.

# Overview of the Project
**Background**

Louise wanted an analysis to show how campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using a Kickstarter dataset, we were able to organize and analyze the data for these key trends and recommend several goals to help her reach her fundraising goal. The following analysis includes explanations and visuals to better illustrate these recommendations. 

**Goal**

The goal of this project was providing my client, Louise, with two criteria in ensuring a successful Kickstarter campaign in the area of performing arts. These are a preferred launch date and a suggested goal amount. Through analzying over 1000 successful and failed campaigns, ranging back nearly ten years and from less than $1000 to more than $50,000, it is possible to provide suggestions on these two key metrics.
